= Using React with Redux

:hp-tags: notes react

== Actions

if a action need to use the parameter, onClick = funciton (event){}, just create the function, but don't forget the event, maybe you need to use event.preventDefault() function if it is a button here.

for convenience, you may define the variable in this.props to local variable or constant with es6 new syntax `const {action} = this.prop`
